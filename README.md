# File Encoder 
This is a project that I've been working on to learn C. I am to be able to take in a inputted file and be able to compress it to a smaller file and then be able to encrypt it with the same code 

## Overview 

### Process 
I am looking to be able to do this by using C, hoping to learn more about memory management and the other complications of C as well as the basic syntax by completing this project. I am planning on using the RLE compression algorithm but that may change depending on how simple or complicated I plan on making this project
